                    <p>
                        Building a high-throughput backend in Go is usually a
                        "honeymoon phase" experience. Everything feels fast and
                        light until your traffic spikes, and suddenly your p99
                        latency starts looking like a mountain range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have ever seen your API "stutter" under pressure,
                        you are not alone. Go's concurrency model is
                        world-class, but at a certain scale, the difference
                        between a smooth ride and a bumpy one comes down to how
                        you treat the Go runtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's look at how to keep your services lightning-fast
                        and your latency curves flat.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1) Be kind to the Garbage Collector (GC)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Go's GC is incredibly smart, but it is a bit like a
                        roommate who cleans up after you: the more mess you
                        make, the more often they have to stop what they are
                        doing to tidy up. In Go, "mess" equals heap allocations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The secret weapon:</strong> use
                        <code>sync.Pool</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why it works: instead of throwing away a "used" object
                        (like a byte buffer) and asking for a brand-new one, you
                        put it in a pool. Next time you need one, you just grab
                        it from the pool. This keeps the GC from having to work
                        overtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quick tip: want to see where your "mess" is coming from?
                        Run
                        <code>go build -gcflags="-m"</code> to see your code's
                        escape analysis. It will tell you exactly which
                        variables are escaping to the heap.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2) Give your app some boundaries</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since Go 1.19, we have two dials we can turn to keep
                        things stable:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>GOMEMLIMIT:</strong> a soft ceiling. Set it to
                        about 80-90% of your container's limit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>GOGC:</strong> controls how aggressive the GC
                        is. If you have RAM to spare, raise it (for example,
                        200).
                    </p>

                    <h3>3) Don't let locks slow you down</h3>
                    <p>
                        High throughput means lots of goroutines trying to talk
                        at once. If they are all fighting over a single
                        <code>sync.Mutex</code>, they will queue up and stall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fix: sharding. Instead of one giant map with one
                        giant lock, break your data into 16 or 32 smaller
                        buckets, each with its own lock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For simple counters, skip the lock entirely and use the
                        <code>sync/atomic</code> package.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4) Pick the right tools for the job</h3>
                    <p>When the load is heavy, specialized tools can help.</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Task</th>
                                <th>Recommendation</th>
                                <th>Why</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>JSON</td>
                                <td>segmentio/encoding/json</td>
                                <td>
                                    Faster than the standard library for heavy
                                    loads.
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>I/O</td>
                                <td>bufio.Writer</td>
                                <td>
                                    Batches small writes to reduce overhead.
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Timeouts</td>
                                <td>context.WithTimeout</td>
                                <td>Prevents requests from hanging forever.</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <h3>5) Use the X-ray (pprof)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Guessing is hard mode. Go's built-in profiler,
                        <code>pprof</code>, shows exactly where CPU and memory
                        are going. Run it during load tests to find the real
                        bottleneck.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The steady-state checklist</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reuse memory with <code>sync.Pool</code>.</li>
                        <li>
                            Respect memory limits with <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduce lock contention with sharding or atomics.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Review performance regularly with
                            <code>pprof</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        High performance does not have to be a headache. With a
                        few tweaks to how you handle memory and concurrency, you
                        can keep your Go backends running smooth as silk.
